    "Your function should accept images of dtype `uint8` or `float`.    It is easiest if you work with the image as data type `float`.   If the input image is of type `uint8`, it is suggested that you convert it to dtype `float`, construct the output image also as type `float` and then convert it back to `uint8` before returning it.  In any case, the output image returned should be the same dtype as the input image."
